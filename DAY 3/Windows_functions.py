# | Function                                        | Typical Use Cases & Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
# | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
# | **ROW\_NUMBER()**                               | - Assign unique rankings to rows within partitions.<br>- Pick *exactly one* top/bottom row per group.<br>**Example:** Find the highest-paid employee in each department.                                                                                             |
# | **RANK()**                                      | - Ranking with gaps if there are ties.<br>- When you want to know relative positions but keep gaps for ties.<br>**Example:** Leaderboard showing tied scores with same rank but skipping next rank.                                                                  |
# | **DENSE\_RANK()**                               | - Ranking without gaps for ties.<br>- Use when ranking ties but want continuous ranking numbers.<br>**Example:** Product sales ranking where no ranks are skipped despite ties.                                                                                      |
# | **NTILE(n)**                                    | - Divide data into roughly equal groups (quartiles, percentiles).<br>- Use for bucket analysis or grouping by ranges.<br>**Example:** Classify customers into top 25%, next 25%, etc., based on sales.                                                               |
# | **LAG() / LEAD()**                              | - Compare current row with previous/next row.<br>- Calculate differences over time.<br>- Identify trends or changes.<br>**Example:** Calculate month-over-month sales change.                                                                                        |
# | **FIRST\_VALUE() / LAST\_VALUE()**              | - Get the first/last value within a partition.<br>- Useful in time-series for baseline or latest value.<br>**Example:** Show employeeâ€™s first salary or latest promotion date in their department.                                                                   |
# | **SUM() / AVG() / COUNT() as Window Functions** | - Compute running totals, moving averages, or partition-wise aggregates.<br>- Useful in financial reports, cumulative statistics, or group comparisons.<br>**Example:** Calculate cumulative sales by date or average salary per department alongside each employee. |
# | **ROWS BETWEEN**                                | - Customize the window frame to define how many rows before/after to consider.<br>- Useful for moving averages, cumulative sums, or lagged comparisons.<br>**Example:** 7-day moving average of daily sales.                                                         |
